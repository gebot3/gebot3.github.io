Hey!, I’m Bagus and I’m Experienced **Technical Artist** and **Game Developer** specializing in **real-time shaders, VFX, and rendering pipelines in Unity**.

I work at the intersection of art and engineering — bridging artists and programmers to transform creative vision into **scalable, production-ready visuals** across **PC and mobile platforms**.

My focus is on building:
- High-performance shader systems  
- Stylized and realistic lighting pipelines  
- Real-time VFX and post-processing  
- Tools that enable artists to iterate faster  

I care deeply about **visual quality, performance, and workflow**, ensuring that every effect not only looks great, but also ships reliably in real-world production.

## What I Do

- Design and implement custom **Unity shaders (HLSL & Shader Graph)**
- Build **VFX systems** using particles system or VFX Graph
- Develop **custom lighting shader** for stylized and realistic projects
- Optimize graphics for **mobile and low-end hardware**
- Create **tools and workflows** that empower artists

## Why Technical Art

I enjoy solving visual problems through code.

Whether it’s crafting a lighting model, tuning a particle system, or building a new rendering feature, my goal is always the same:  
**make visuals that are beautiful, efficient, and easy to use in production.**
